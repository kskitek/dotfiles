History
========

2.1.4 (2019-06-02)
------------------

* Handle BadStatusLine errors

2.1.3 (2019-06-01)
------------------

* Fix issue where update_note was actually modifying the external note object passed to it rather than creating a copy and returning that.

2.1.2 (2019-04-07)
------------------

* Fix error in version number

2.1.1 (2019-04-07)
------------------

* Handle invalid/expired tokens
* Fixed KeyError in get_note_list() when offline
* Fix order of note, status for trash_note

2.1.0 (2018-11-04)
------------------

* Adds since paramter back in (as Simperium cursor, not date)

2.0.3 (2018-10-19)
------------------

* No end facing change in functionality - just removes a superfluous default modificationDate

2.0.2 (2018-10-03)
------------------

* Actually remove the since support like I thought I had. I could have
  re-implemented since in as per tags so it filters after pulling everything
  else, but since (ha!) I used "since" for a faster note loading there seems
  little point.

2.0.1 (2018-10-03)
------------------

* Documentation updatess only

2.0.0 (2018-09-29)
------------------

* Update to the Simperium API: https://simperium.com/docs/http/
* Breaking changes:
  * The since parameter has been removed. Simperium supports the since parameter, but as a cursor, not a date.
  * The syncnum key no longer exists (this is an upstream change)
  * Things seem to be UTF-8 by default
* This should largely be a drop in replacement though: E.g. Simperium uses id instead of key, but simplenote.py handles that for you.

-------------------
