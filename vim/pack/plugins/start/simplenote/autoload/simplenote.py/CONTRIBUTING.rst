Contribute
===========
You already have code or an idea for code you want to contribute:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix based on master.
* Run the tests (See below).
* Add tests for your feature if you can and it is appropriate. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with version.
* Send me a pull request, let me know what tests fail as a result of the changes.

You don't already have any code, nor any ideas for code, but still want to contribute code somehow:

First bear in mind that simplenote.py is fairly stable and feature complete. I don't anticipate much work being required until Simperium finally decide to switch over to the Simperium API.

* Have a look through issues labelled "easier" or "harder" depending on how ambitious you are feeling.
* Then run through the steps as per above.
* Feel free to link to your fork in the issue before submitting a pull request if you want a review.
* Or just open the pull request. A pull request doesn't have to start with the finished code.

You have ideas/bugs:

* Just open an issue with your idea/bug.

Tests
======
Before making a pull request or sending a patch it is recommended you run the tests against the most recent version of Python 2 and Python 3. I.e::

    python27 tests/test_simplenote.py

and::

    python34 tests/test_simplenote.py
